## Round A:

**K-Goodness String:**
Charles defines the goodness score of a string as the number of indices i such that Si≠SN−i+1 where 1≤i≤N/2 (1-indexed). For example, the string CABABC has a goodness score of 2 since S2≠S5 and S3≠S4.
Charles gave Ada a string S of length N, consisting of uppercase letters and asked her to convert it into a string with a goodness score of K. In one operation, Ada can change any character in the string to any uppercase letter. Could you help Ada find the minimum number of operations required to transform the given string into a string with goodness score equal to K?

## Round B:

**Increasing Substring:**
Your friend John just came back from vacation, and he would like to share with you a new property that he learned about strings. John learned that a string C of length L consisting of uppercase English characters is strictly increasing if, for every pair of indices i and j such that 1≤i<j≤L (1-based), the character at position i is smaller than the character at position j. For example, the strings ABC and ADF are strictly increasing, however the strings ACC and FDA are not.
Now that he taught you this new exciting property, John decided to challenge you: given a string S of length N, you have to find out, for every position 1≤i≤N, what is the length of the longest strictly increasing substring that ends at position i.
